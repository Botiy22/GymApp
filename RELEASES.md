# Release versions

`js/release.js` is the single source of the app's public version, build number and derived cache ID. Both the page and service worker load it. The app displays the installed version/build in Settings and in a verified update-success message.

For each published change, increment the public version and choose a new build (`YYYYMMDD.sequence`). Use patch versions for fixes, minor versions for new compatible features, and major versions for breaking changes. Update this log in the same commit. Do not edit app.js/sw.js version constants separately.

An unfinished development branch uses a `-dev` suffix. Before publishing finished work, remove that suffix and select a version newer than main. Never merge the unfinished exercise migration just to update its version.

## 2.3.0 — 2026-10-07, build 20261007.6

- Local, API-key-free assisted PDF/DOCX/XLSX plan import with bundled PDF.js 5.6.205 (Apache-2.0).
- One or two documents, location-referenced source text and OOXML table rows, limited explicit-format recognition and editable workout/weekly meal preview.
- Exact exercise selection, required missing fields, review approval, JSON download and separate diet-replacement approval.
- New routines append; the original split, diaries, active workout and account/sync stay intact.
- Scanned PDFs have no OCR; unusual layouts require manual completion. No invented nutrition or rest-range midpoint.
- PDF reader and worker are included in the versioned service-worker shell.
- Source/diff review and syntax checks only; no tests or real PDF/mobile/account checks run.
- This release contains only PDF import; the exercise catalogue PR remains separate.

Earlier changes displayed `2.0` without a complete release log. Their actual commits remain the source of history; historical version numbers have not been invented.

Validation: source/diff review and JavaScript syntax checks. No tests or browser interaction/offline checks run.
